=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-mojomojox-convert-kwiki@rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be
notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.

=head1 DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module,
please consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of
free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support
you'd care to offer.

Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order
for me to continue working on this particular software. I will
continue to do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it
interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work
on this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can
consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
best.

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use
the button on this page:
